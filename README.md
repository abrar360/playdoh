Playdoh: Mass apply to jobs via browser agents while tailoring resume to each one.


Allows for an effortless spray-and-pray approach to applying to jobs while using LLMs to carefully tailor job experience to defeat automated resume filtering and ranking systems.

Current capabilities allow for reliably bypassing Greenhouse applicant tracking systems and Cloudflare verification on job-boards.

To use, just run browser-use-apply-batch.py

This repo relies on imamousenotacat's fork of browser-use called re-browser-use:
